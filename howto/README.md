#instructions to build the Dynatrace UFO

##Print the 7 pieces in 5 batches

1. UFO case base + microcontroller holder, plus microcontroller clip
black filament
2. UFO case top + cable stabilizer + mini-switch-clip
black filament
3. separator ring
black filament
4. Downlight inlay + first ring
transparent filament
5. Second ring

##Prepare USB cable



##Prepare LED strips
Cut the LED strip in pieces of 2 strips with 15 LEDs each and 2 strips with 2 LEDs each. Please make sure you cut exactly in the middle of the soldering tabs, because you will need to solder cables later there. Check out the cutting mark.

##Solder short strips
Solder the short strips in a series accordingly to the data-flow direction. There are arrows on the strip that show you the direction. Data for controlling the bus of LEDs flows from the microcontroller outbound in direction of arrow.
