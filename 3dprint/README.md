#print your own ufo

the idea is that people can print their own ufo and all they need is to order an Adafruit Huzzah, some wires, and print the ufo in black and transparent filament. The Huzzahs ESP8266 hosts Wifi and a Web server so that REST calls plus a simple Hybrid web app are used to configure and control the ufo device.
